# Parflow_HESS

Matlab scripts and datasets included here are provided to demonstrate the workflow for performing dimensionless-scaled sensitivity (DSS) 
and Method of Morris sensitivity analyses on simulated model outputs (recharge rates) from the Parflow hydrologic model.

Example Parflow .tcl scripts are included here as well, but the model files themselves are not, given files size limitations. Please
contact me at srmap@ucdavis.edu if you would like to have access to these files and I will be happy to provide them for you.
